# Commutative Algebra

Goal: cover the ring-theoretic infrastructure that underlies algebraic geometry and modern number theory.

## Design Choice

`Ideal` is represented as a predicate `is_ideal[R: CommRing](contains: R -> Bool) -> Bool`
in `src/ideal.ac`, split into three named sub-constraints
(`ideal_zero_constraint`, `ideal_add_constraint`, `ideal_absorb_constraint`).
No bundled `Ideal[R]` structure is introduced yet — bundle later if a use site
requires it. Prototype includes `zero_ideal`, `unit_ideal`, `principal_ideal`,
their `is_ideal` proofs, plus `principal_ideal_zero_eq_zero_ideal` and
`principal_ideal_one_eq_unit_ideal`. The lattice API uses `ideal_subset`,
`ideal_inter` (meet), `ideal_sum` (join), with `zero_ideal` as bottom and
`unit_ideal` as top. It includes GLB/LUB iff lemmas, commutativity,
associativity, idempotence, absorption under inclusion, zero/unit identities,
plus the helper `is_ideal_unfold` and `is_ideal_from_constraints` for
assembling `is_ideal` from its sub-constraints.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add quotient rings and their universal properties (see [quotient-rings/todo.md](quotient-rings/todo.md))
- [ ] Support prime ideals, maximal ideals, and local rings
      (predicate-form `is_prime_ideal`, `is_maximal_ideal`, basic
      extraction lemmas, the maximal-implies-prime theorem, and bundled
      `PrimeIdeal[R]`/`MaximalIdeal[R]` with `as_ideal`/`as_prime_ideal`
      coercions added in `src/ideal.ac`; field ↔ zero-maximal added in
      `src/field_ideal.ac`; `IntegralDomain` typeclass and integral-domain
      ↔ zero-prime added in `src/integral_domain.ac` with `Real` as an
      instance; predicate-form `is_local_ring` with uniqueness lemmas
      and field-is-local-ring added in `src/local_ring.ac`; bundled
      `LocalRing[R]` with `as_maximal_ideal` coercion and uniqueness
      lemmas added in `src/local_ring.ac`; `is_unit` predicate with
      one/mul/witness lemmas and the `non_units` set plus
      field-non-unit-iff-zero characterization added in
      `src/comm_ring_unit.ac`; `non_units` set predicate plus
      `ideal_with_unit_eq_unit_ideal`, `proper_ideal_no_units`, and
      `proper_ideal_subset_non_units` added in `src/comm_ring_unit.ac`;
      `non_units_ideal_is_maximal`, `non_units_ideal_maximal_unique`,
      and `non_units_ideal_implies_local_ring` added in
      `src/local_ring.ac`; still needed: the local-ring-implies-non-units-form-an-ideal
      converse, which requires every non-unit lying in a maximal ideal)
- [ ] Add localization at submonoids and prime ideals
- [ ] Develop Noetherian rings and modules
- [ ] Support integral elements and integral extensions
- [ ] Add fraction fields and localization-based field-of-fractions constructions
- [ ] Build tensor products and base-change lemmas
- [ ] Add radicals, nilradicals, and Jacobson radicals
- [ ] Develop PID, UFD, and related standard commutative-algebra classes
