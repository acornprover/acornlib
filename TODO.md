# Things to Do Next

After the binomial theorem is complete, the natural progression is to work on infinite series and the exponential function:

## 1. Cauchy Products
Define and prove properties of the Cauchy product of two infinite series.

The Cauchy product of two series `∑ aₙ` and `∑ bₙ` is:
```
∑ cₙ where cₙ = ∑_{k=0}^{n} aₖ * b_{n-k}
```

**Why it matters:** This is essential for proving `e^x * e^y = e^(x+y)` and other properties of power series.

**Prerequisites:**
- Convergence theorems for infinite series (may already exist in `src/real/real_series.ac`)
- Summation manipulation theorems
- The binomial theorem provides the finite version of this product

**Key theorems to prove:**
- [ ] Cauchy product convergence: If `∑ aₙ` and `∑ bₙ` both converge absolutely, their Cauchy product converges
- [ ] Cauchy product formula: `(∑ aₙ) * (∑ bₙ) = ∑ cₙ` where `cₙ = ∑_{k=0}^{n} aₖ * b_{n-k}`

## 2. Define e^x via Partial Sums
Define the exponential function for real numbers using the power series:
```
e^x = ∑_{n=0}^{∞} x^n / n!
```

**Implementation approach:**
- Define as a limit: `exp(x) = limit(partial(function(n) { x^n / n! }, _))`
- Prove convergence for all real x
- May need to work with Real or Rat first, then generalize

**Files involved:**
- New file `src/real/real_exp.ac` or extend `src/real/real_series.ac`
- Will need factorial for Real (lift from Nat factorial)

## 3. Prove Properties of e^x
Once e^x is defined, prove its fundamental properties:

**Essential theorems:**
- [ ] `exp_zero`: `e^0 = 1`
- [ ] `exp_add`: `e^x * e^y = e^(x+y)` (uses Cauchy product!)
- [ ] `exp_pos`: `e^x > 0` for all x
- [ ] `exp_derivative`: `d/dx(e^x) = e^x` (if we develop calculus)
- [ ] Relationship to natural logarithm (if we define ln)
- [ ] Taylor series convergence properties

**Connection to binomial theorem:**
The binomial theorem gives the finite approximation:
```
(1 + x/n)^n = ∑_{k=0}^{n} (n choose k) * (x/n)^k
```
As n → ∞, this approaches e^x, providing an alternative definition and a bridge between discrete and continuous mathematics.
